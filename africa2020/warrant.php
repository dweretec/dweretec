    <td width="215" valign="top"><p><strong>“ I bought a cell phone on eBay</strong>.<br />
      I usually don't buy warranties but the low cost decided to give it a try.    What a great purchase it turned out to be! <br />
      <br />
      The cell phone completely quit working -<br />
      I sent the phone in the next day. SquareTrade refunded the purchase price of    the cell phone. SquareTrade kept me informed every step of the process! I    will definitely use them again! <strong>”</strong></p></td>
    <td width="215" valign="top"><p><strong>“ I purchased a Magellan GPS last year</strong>, and the    device failed. Then I remembered I took advantage of the SquareTrade Warranty    offered. <br />
      <br />
      The process was quick and efficient. After sending back (postage paid) the    unit, my Paypal account was credited for the original purchase price (minus    shipping). The units have come down in price, so it was a total score when I    shopped for a replacement. <strong>”</strong></p></td>
    <td width="210" valign="top"><p><strong>“ I purchased a warranty on a camera I won on ebay</strong>. I don't    usually go for warranties, but the cost through Square Trade was quite    reasonable. <br />
      <br />
      Four months later the camera stopped working. I got a full refund with no    problems from Square Trade. I was very impressed with Square Trade. I will    consider Square Trade warranties in the future and will recommend them to    anyone. <strong>”</strong></p></td>
