			<p><b>Adoptionism</b>, also called dynamic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchianism" title="Monarchianism">monarchianism</a>, was a minority Christian belief that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> was born merely human and that he became divine later in his life. By these accounts, Jesus earned the title Christ through his sinless devotion to the will of God, thereby becoming the perfect sacrifice to redeem humanity. Adoptionists typically portray two key points in Jesus' life as stages in Jesus' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosis" title="Theosis">theosis</a>: his baptism and his resurrection. They consider God to have given Jesus his miraculous power and divine authority after Jesus proved his holiness. Adoptionism arose among <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Christians" title="Early Christians" class="mw-redirect">early Christians</a> seeking to reconcile the claims that Jesus was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_of_God" title="Son of God">son of God</a> with the monotheism of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism" title="Judaism">Judaism</a><sup class="noprint Template-Fact" title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from April 2007" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Adoptionism was common before it was first declared heresy at the end of the 2nd century. Some scholars see adoptionist concepts in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Mark" title="Gospel of Mark">Gospel of Mark</a> and in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_epistles" title="Pauline epistles">Pauline epistles</a> (Mark 1:11 and Romans 1:4).</p>
<p>Adoptionism was condemned by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Church" title="Christian Church">church</a> as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_heresy" title="Christian heresy">heresy</a> at various times. The belief contradicts the orthodox doctrine of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity" title="Trinity">Trinity</a>, defined at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea" title="First Council of Nicaea">First Council of Nicaea</a>, which identifies Jesus as eternally God.</p>
<p>The term "adoptionism" is thus, through the influence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_von_Harnack" title="Adolf von Harnack">Harnack's</a> <i>Dogmengeschichte</i>, applied to this heretical stream in early Greek theology, which regarded Christ as a man gifted with divine powers, a view first represented by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebionites" title="Ebionites">Ebionites</a> and later developed by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchianism" title="Monarchianism">Monarchians</a>. It must be distinguished from <b>adoptianism</b>, the much later heresy, originating in eight-century Spain, according to which Christ, in his humanity, is not the true, but only the adoptive, Son of God.</p>
<p>This teaching, attributed among others to the Eighth Century <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix,_Bishop_of_Urgel" title="Felix, Bishop of Urgel" class="mw-redirect">Felix, Bishop of Urgel</a> was criticized as adoptianist by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin" title="Alcuin">Alcuin</a>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Frankfurt" title="Council of Frankfurt">Council of Frankfurt</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/794" title="794">794</a> condemned it as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heretic" title="Heretic">heretical</a>, as did another council held in Rome in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/798" title="798">798</a>.</p>
<p>It was revived in a modified form in the twelfth century by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelard" title="Abelard" class="mw-redirect">Abelard</a> and others. In later times <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duns_Scotus" title="Duns Scotus">Duns Scotus</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Su%C3%A1rez" title="Francisco Suárez">Francisco Suárez</a> and others attempted to interpret in an orthodox sense the statement that Jesus as man is the adopted Son of God, but these theories were all rejected as subversive of a sound Christology.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoptionism#cite_note-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
